    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm <strong>Shubham Tayde</strong>, a DevOps Engineer from Nagpur, India.
        My passion lies in building robust, scalable systems that empower development teams
        to deliver faster and more reliably. I specialize in cloud infrastructure,
        automation, and continuous delivery pipelines.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, I've worked on various projects involving AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform,
        and Jenkins â€” helping teams bridge the gap between development and operations.
        I enjoy solving real-world engineering problems and implementing modern DevOps practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, mentoring junior engineers,
        and staying up to date with the ever-evolving cloud-native ecosystem.
